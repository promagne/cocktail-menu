# ST. JOHN FRIZZELL FORT DEFIANCE BROOKLYN

Named for the 1850s poem by Rudyard Kipling, St. John Frizzell appropriately calls for a brand of Scotch gin by the name of Old Raj and asks to be shaken with cardamom pods, a spice native to India. As with all great tiki drinks, the Gunga Din takes the drinker on a transcontinental journey, just by means of the ingredients in the glass.

## Ingredients:
- **3 cardamom pods**
- **¾ ounce** Simple syrup
- **¾ ounce** Lime juice
- **1 ounce** Pineapple juice
- **2 ounces** London dry gin (preferably Old Raj 110)

## Garnish:
Pineapple fronds

## Instructions:
Combine the cardamom pods and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker and muddle fragment. Add the gin, pineapple fronds, juice, and lime juice. Add ice and shake until chilled, about 10 seconds. Fine strain ("fire-mesh strainer," page 51) into a tiki mug filled with ice. Top with tonic water and stir gently to combine. Garnish with pineapple fronds.
