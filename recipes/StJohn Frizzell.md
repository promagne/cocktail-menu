# St. John Frizzell Fort Defiance Brooklyn

Named for the 1850s poem by Rudyard Kipling, St. John Frizzell appropriately calls for a brand of Scotch gin by the name of Old Raj and asks to be shaken with cardamom pods, a spice native to India. As with all great tiki drinks, the Gunga Din takes the drinker on a transcontinental journey, just by means of the ingredients in the glass.

## Ingredients:
- **3** Cardamom Pods
- **¾ oz** Simple syrup
- **quartered** Lime juice
- **1 oz** Pineapple juice
- **2 oz** London Dry Gin(preferably Old Raj 110)

## Instructions:
1. Combine the cardamom pods and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker and muddle fragment. 
2. Add the gin, pineapple fronds, juice, and lime juice. 
3. Add ice and shake until chilled, about 10 seconds. 
4. Fine strain into a tiki mug filled with ice. 
5. Top with tonic water and stir gently to combine. 
6. Garnish with pineapple fronds.
