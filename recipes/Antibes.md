# Antibes

This was one of the first cocktails I ever recommended in my old Washington Post spirits column, and it's still a favorite. It's a twist on the Salty Dog, with a little Benedictine in the mix. The honeyed, earthy, herbal flavors of the liqueur mingle beautifully with the grapefruit and the gin botanicals.

## Ingredients:
- **2 Ounces** Gin
- **1/2 Ounce** Benedictine
- **2 Ounces** Grapefruit juice, fresh squeezed
- **grapefruit Wedge**, For Garnish

## Instructions:
Fill a shaker with ice. Add gin, Benedictine, and grapefruit juice. Shake vigorously, then strain into a rocks glass with ice cubes (or one nice big ice cube). Garnish with wedge.
