# Millionaire Cocktail

This rendition of the classic features a fruity medley of rum, apricot, and sloe gin.

Several cocktails bearing the Millionaire moniker have been in circulation since 1914. This version is adapted from a 1917 recipe (following the recommendations of Ted Haigh in his 2004 book, Vintage Spirits & Forgotten Cocktails), adjusting the proportions to better suit contemporary palates.
