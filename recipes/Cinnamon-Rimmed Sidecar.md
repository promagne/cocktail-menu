# Cinnamon-Rimmed Sidecar  

## Ingredients

- **Ice cubes**
- **1 ounce** Calvados or other apple brandy
- **1 ounce** Cointreau
- **1 ounce** freshly squeezed lemon juice
- **Orange peel twist**, for garnish

## Instructions:

For the glass (optional): Combine the sugar and cinnamon on a small plate. Moisten half of the rim of a cocktail (martini) glass with the lemon wedge, then carefully dip the moistened rim into the sugar-cinnamon mixture to create an even coating on only the very top edge. Place the glass in the freezer to let the sugar mixture harden; this should take about 10 minutes.

  
For the drink: Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice cubes. Add the Calvados, Cointreau and lemon juice. Shake well, then strain into either an unadorned or sugared-rim cocktail glass.
### For the Rim:

- **1 teaspoon** superfine sugar
- **1/4 teaspoon** freshly ground cinnamon
- **Lemon wedge**
