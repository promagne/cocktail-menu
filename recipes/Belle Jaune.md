# Belle Jaune

A refreshing cocktail featuring gin, lemon, thyme syrup, and cucumber.

## Ingredients:
- **2 oz** Gin (preferably London Dry style)
- **3/4 oz** Fresh lemon juice
- **1/2 oz** Thyme syrup
- **3-4** Thin slices of cucumber (about 1-2 inches of cucumber)
- **Garnish:** Thyme sprig and/or cucumber slice

## For the thyme syrup:
- **1 cup** water
- **1 cup** sugar
- **6-8** fresh thyme sprigs

## Instructions:
1. First, make the thyme syrup by bringing water to a simmer, adding sugar and stirring until dissolved. Add thyme sprigs, remove from heat, and let steep for 20-30 minutes. Strain and cool before using.

2. In a cocktail shaker, gently muddle the cucumber slices.

3. Add the gin, fresh lemon juice, and thyme syrup.

4. Fill with ice and shake vigorously for about 15 seconds.

5. Double strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass.

6. Garnish with a fresh thyme sprig and/or cucumber slice.

## Notes:
"Belle Jaune" means "Beautiful Yellow" in French, referring to the cocktail's yellow hue from the lemon juice and thyme syrup. This is a refreshing spring or summer cocktail with a nice balance of bright citrus, herbal notes, and the cooling effect of cucumber.
