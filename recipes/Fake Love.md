# Fake Love

This is a great twist on the traditional French 75 (which frankly always works best with Cognac). But the Fake Love cocktail also has a bittersweet, poetic back story, according to Océane: "I created this cocktail for the guy who made me stay in Cognac. Basically it's not the type of cocktail that I like but this one was an emotional one based on his tastes and on where he works. We were not in a relationship but I really loved him. He was my breath of fresh air."

## Ingredients:
- **1.5 Ounces** Cognac
- **3/4 Ounce** Raspberry Juice(or 1/2 Ounce raspberry syrup)
- **1/2 Ounce** Rosemary Syrup(infuse rosemary in your normal simple syrup)
- **3/4 Ounce** Lemon juice
- **2 Dashes** Lemon bitters
- **Sparking Wine** (preferably méthode traditionnelle)

## Instructions:
Pour all ingredients except sparkling wine into a shaker, fill with ice, and shake well. Strain into a coupe or champagne flute. Top with sparkling wine (2-3 ounces). Garnish with...ennui.
